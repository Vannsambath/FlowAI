📜 Privacy Policy for Flow Auto Extension
(Last Updated: November 2025)
This Privacy Policy governs the use of the Flow Auto Chrome Extension ("the Extension") provided by [VANNSAMBATH]. We are fully committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring transparency in all our data practices.
1. Single Purpose and Core Functionality
The Flow Auto Extension is a single-purpose tool dedicated exclusively to automating and streamlining the video generation process on the Google Flow platform (https://labs.google/*). All code, permissions, and features are strictly confined to this core task.
2. Information We Collect (Data Minimization)
We adhere strictly to the principle of data minimization. The Extension handles only the data necessary to perform its functions.
a. Local Data Stored (via chrome.storage)
The Extension uses the chrome.storage API to store certain operational data locally within your browser. This data includes:
•	Custom Prompt Lists: The sequences of video prompts you input for automation.
•	Generation Settings: Your preferred parameters for the automation process.
This local data is NEVER transmitted to us (the developer) or any third-party server.
b. Information Handled
•	Video Files: The Extension uses the downloads permission to manage the automatic download of video files generated by the Google Flow platform. These files are saved directly to your local machine and are not intercepted, stored, or viewed by the Extension developer.
•	Host Data: The Extension's host_permissions allow interaction with elements only on the https://labs.google/* domain to automate button clicks and input fields. No other browsing data is accessed.
c. Information We DO NOT Collect
The Flow Auto Extension DOES NOT collect, transmit, store, or share any Personally Identifiable Information (PII), sensitive personal data, financial information, browsing history, or IP addresses. We do not use any third-party analytics or tracking services.
3. Permissions Justification
The following permissions are requested in the manifest and are essential for the Extension's core purpose:
Permission	Purpose
activeTab	Required to inject automation scripts and monitor the active tab state only when the user clicks the extension icon.
downloads	Necessary to manage the automatic download of the completed video files to the user's local machine.
storage	Used to persistently save user-created prompt lists and settings locally in the browser.
sidePanel	Required to provide the primary user interface for controlling automation within the dedicated Chrome Side Panel.
4. Changes to this Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will update the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy and include an updated version in all future extension packages submitted to the Chrome Web Store.
